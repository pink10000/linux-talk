  speaker_note: | 
  Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, and others at Bell Labs begin development on UNIX. It establishes many core concepts like the command-line interface, hierarchical file system, and the "everything is a file" philosophy that Linux would later adopt.
  --

  Richard Stallman launches the GNU Project with the goal of creating a completely free and open-source UNIX-like operating system. He and others create essential tools like the GCC compiler and the Bash shell, but they lack a kernel.
  --

  Linus Torvalds, a student in Finland, posts a now-famous message to a newsgroup announcing his new hobby project: a free operating system kernel.
  --

  The Linux kernel is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL). This is a critical moment. It allows developers to legally combine the GNU project's tools with the Linux kernel to create a complete, free operating system, often called GNU/Linux.
  --

  The first major Linux distributions, like Slackware and Debian, are created. These packages bundle the kernel with software and a package manager, making Linux accessible to a wider audience.
  --

  Commercial companies like Red Hat begin selling and supporting Linux distributions. This, combined with the rise of the internet, leads to Linux becoming the backbone of the dot-com boom, powering web servers around the world as the "L" in the LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack.
  --

  Google launches Android, an operating system for mobile devices built on top of the Linux kernel. This puts Linux into the hands of billions of users globally.
  --
  Linux completely dominates cloud computing, supercomputing, and the Internet of Things (IoT). It runs the vast majority of the world's servers and is even integrated into its old rival's OS via the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).
