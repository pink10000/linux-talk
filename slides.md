*Did you know?*

Linux Torvalds announced in 1996 that there would be a mascot for Linux, a penguin. This was because when they were about to select the mascot, Torvalds mentioned he was bitten by a little penguin (Eudyptula minor) on a visit to the National Zoo & Aquarium in Canberra, Australia. It's name is `Tux`.

  Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, and others at Bell Labs begin development on UNIX. It establishes many core concepts like the command-line interface, hierarchical file system, and the "everything is a file" philosophy that Linux would later adopt.

  Richard Stallman launches the GNU Project with the goal of creating a completely free and open-source UNIX-like operating system. He and others create essential tools like the GCC compiler and the Bash shell, but they lack a kernel.

<!-- 
  speaker_note: |
  The Linux kernel is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL). This is a critical moment. It allows developers to legally combine the GNU project's tools with the Linux kernel to create a complete, free operating system, often called GNU/Linux.

<!-- 
  speaker_note: | 
  The first major Linux distributions, like Slackware, Debian, Red Hat Linux are created. These packages bundle the kernel with software and a package manager, making Linux accessible to a wider audience. -->

  speaker_note: |
  Commerical companies began selling and supporting Linux distributions
  For example, 
  - 1999: IBM joined forces with Red Hat, announcing support for Linux
  - 1999: Dell began pre-installing Linux on select servers
  - 2000: The GNOME and KDE desktop environments evolved, making Linux more user friendly for desktop users.
  - 2000: IBM invested $1 billion in Linux development.
  This, combined with the rise of the internet, led to Linux becoming the backbone of the dot-com boom and powered web servers around the world.
